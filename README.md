# WinApp
## What is this?
WinApp is a remote control software. You can write something or execute cmd commands from another app. It hides itself as "Windows Application" and looks like a background app.
## How to use?
#### Sending Commands
You can install the apk file to send commands or create a command account. But it won't be published for a while.
#### Computer Application
The computer application just can get commands and execute them. So, it will be useless until the mobile app will be published.
If you didn't install a "ready to use without login", you must input your receiver ID (You will get your receiver ID, when you create an account). Then, it will start working. You will not need to login again.
##### Commands
You can learn how to create WinApp commands from mobile app when it is published.
